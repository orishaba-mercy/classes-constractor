// You are working on a web application for a car rental company. They want to keep track
// of their car inventory and rental information. Your task is to create a JavaScript class or
// function constructor for representing cars in their inventory and another one for
// representing rental information.
// Requirements:
// 1) Create a Car class or function constructor that has the following properties:
// a. make (string): The make of the car, e.g., "Toyota".
// b. model (string): The model of the car, e.g., "Camry".
// c. year (number): The year the car was manufactured, e.g., 2020.
// d. isAvailable (boolean): Indicates if the car is currently available for rent.
// The Car class or function constructor should also have a method called
// toggleAvailability that changes the isAvailable property to its opposite value (true to
// false, false to true)

class Car{
    constructor(make,model,year,isAvailable){
        this.make=make
        this.model=model
        this.year=year
        this.isAvailable=isAvailable
    }
    toggleAvailability(){
        this.isAvailable=!this.isAvailable
    }
}





// 2) Create a Rental class or function constructor that has the following properties:
// ● car (Car object): The car that has been rented.
// ● renterName (string): The name of the person who rented the car.
// ● rentalStartDate (Date object): The start date of the rental period.
// ● rentalEndDate (Date object): The end date of the rental period.
// The Rental class or function constructor should also have a method called
// calculateRentalDuration that returns the rental duration in days.

class rental{
    constructor(Car,renterName,renterStartDate){
        this.Car=Car
        this.renterName=renterName
        this.renterStartDate=renterStartDate
    }

calculateRentalDuration() {
    const oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // hours * minutes * seconds * milliseconds
    const startDate = new Date(this.rentalStartDate);
    const endDate = new Date(this.rentalEndDate);
    const diffDays = Math.round(Math.abs((startDate - endDate) / oneDay));
    return diffDays;
  }
}


const car1 = new Car("Toyota", "LandCruiser", 2020, true);
const rental1 = new Rental(car1, "Bridget", "2022-01-01", "2022-01-25");
const rentalDuration = rental1.calculateRentalDuration();
console.log(rentalDuration); 






// 3) Create an instance of the Car class or function constructor for a car in the
// inventory. Then, create an instance of the Rental class or function constructor for
// a rental involving the car you created. Finally, calculate the rental duration using
// the calculateRentalDuration method.
// Question2
// You are building a simple quiz app that contains multiple-choice questions. Your task is
// to create two JavaScript classes: Question and Quiz. The Question class will represent
// individual questions, and the Quiz class will manage a collection of questions and the
// user's progress.
// 1. Create a Question class with the following properties:
// ● text(string): The text of the question.
// ● options(array): An array containing the multiple-choice options.
// ● correctAnswer(string): The correct answer to the question.
// The Question class should also have a method called checkAnswer that takes a
// user's answer as a parameter and returns true if the answer is correct and false
// otherwise.
class Question{
    constructor(text,options,correctAnswer){
        this.text=text;
        this.options=options;
        this.correctAnswer=correctAnswer;
    }
    checkAnswer(answer){
        return answer === this.correctAnswer;



    }

    

}


// 2. Create a Quiz class with the following properties:
// ● questions(array):An array of Question objects.
// ● currentQuestionIndex(number): The index of the current question in the
// questions array.
// ● score(number): The user’s current score.
// The Quiz class should have the following methods:
// ● addQuestion: Takes a Question object as a parameter and adds it to the
// questions array.
// ● nextQuestion: Advances to the next question in the quiz by incrementing the
// currentQuestionIndex.
// ● submitAnswer: Takes a user's answer as a parameter, checks if the answer is
// correct using the checkAnswer method of the Question class, and updates the
// score if the answer is correct.
class Quiz {
    constructor() {
      this.questions = [];
      this.currentQuestionIndex = 0;
      this.score = 0;
    }
  
    addQuestion(question) {
      this.questions.push(question);
    }

    nextQuestion() {
        this.currentQuestionIndex++;
      }
      submitAnswer(answer) {
        const currentQuestion = this.questions[this.currentQuestionIndex];
        if (currentQuestion.checkAnswer(answer)) {
          this.score++;
        }
        this.nextQuestion();
      }
  }
  const question1 = new Question(
    "What is the capital of Uganda?",
    ["London", "Kampala", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
   "Kampala"
  );
  console.log(question1)
  
  const question2 = new Question(
    "Which language defines a function as def?",
    ["Java", "Kotlin", "C+", "Python"],
   "Python"
  );
  console.log(question2)
  const quiz = new Quiz();
  quiz.addQuestion(question1);
  quiz.addQuestion(question2);
  
  while (quiz.currentQuestionIndex < quiz.questions.length) {
    const currentQuestion = quiz.questions[quiz.currentQuestionIndex];
    console.log(currentQuestion.text);
    console.log(currentQuestion.options.join(", "));
    const answer = prompt("Enter your answer:");
    quiz.submitAnswer(answer);
  }
  
  console.log(`Your score is ${quiz.score} out of ${quiz.questions.length}.`);
